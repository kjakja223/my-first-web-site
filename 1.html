<h2>Html이란 무엇인가?</h2>

<strong>h1 to h6 tag</strong> are used to express the importance of letters. 
h1 is the most important and the size of the lettet is the biggest.It litterally means the Headings of the page. 
Just for the impormation, I can search the stastical information of frequency of using Tag at "advancedwebbanking.com".
In the page, it says that 25 to 26 tags are used in average in one web page.
Although there are more than 150 tags, I don't need to memorize all of them.
<br><br><strong>br tag</strong> produces a line break in text.
I don't need to put it in the end and I can set how many breaks I would to make by repeating of br.
It is used a lot.
<p>However, by using <strong>p tag</strong>, I can easily change the paraghape of the sentences.
To sum up, br tag is make a break of lines and p tag is to change paragrape.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 40px;">In Html, the space of the p tag is systemically designated, we can not change how big it would be.
However, by using CSS language, we can specifically adjust it's space.
